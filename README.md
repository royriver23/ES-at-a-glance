# Elastic Search at a glance

I'm trying to learn Elastic Search Rails integration, this is a demo using it on top on a simple sqlite database.

I'm basically using [this useful article](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/full-text-search-in-rails-using-elasticsearch--cms-22920).

Gems used so far:

- [elasticsearch-model](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails/tree/master/elasticsearch-model): The elasticsearch-model library builds on top of the the elasticsearch library. It aims to simplify integration of Ruby classes ("models"), commonly found e.g. in Ruby on Rails applications, with the Elasticsearch search and analytics engine.

- [elasticsearch-rails](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rails#elasticsearch): Multiple Elastic Search integrations. 

- [searchkick](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick):  Intelligent search made easy. Searchkick learns what your users are looking for. As more people search, it gets smarter and the results get better. Itâ€™s friendly for developers - and magical for your users.

Reindexing using **SearchKick**:

```bash
rake searchkick:reindex CLASS=Article
```

## Chewy Notes

Check documentation [here](https://github.com/toptal/chewy)

### 1. Create Initializer in `config/initializers/chewy.rb`
### 2. Create yml file in `config/chewy.yml`: 
 
The prefix will be used for prefixing indices created along the way. For instance: `UsersIndex.index_name # => 'test_users'`

### 3. Create an index inside `app/indices`
  
```
class UsersIndex < Chewy::Index
  define_type User.active # or just model instead_of scope: define_type User
end
```

- **define_type:** basically all the elements that would be returned without any filter. In can includes multiple models associations:
    `define_type User.active.includes(:country, :badges, :projects) do`

### 4.
